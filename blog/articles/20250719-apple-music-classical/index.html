            Apple Music Classical Still Doesn’t Understand Classical Music
          </h1>

          <p>
            Apple Music Classical is a welcome upgrade after 25 years of iTunes
            and Apple Music. I’ve spent countless hours wrangling metadata to
            shoehorn classical works into the album–track model. Apple’s new app
            feels like a breath of fresh air, but it isn’t flawless. Here are
            three ways Apple Music Classical still lets classical listeners
            down.
          </p>

          <h2>Siri arbitrarily orders movements</h2>
          <p>
            Driving home from a conducting workshop, I asked Siri to “play
            Brahms’s Third Symphony.”
          </p>
          <p>
            To its credit, Siri got the basics right: Brahms’s Symphony No. 3 on
            Apple Music Classical, not the regular Apple Music. No "Can’t find
            that" nonsense.
          </p>
          <p>
            The result? Baffling. Even while driving, I <em>had</em> to snap a
            screenshot:

            <br /><img
              src="./images/brahms-carplay.png"
              width="500"
              class="lightbox"
              alt='A screenshot of Apple CarPlay showing the track order created by Siri when asked to "Play Brahms third symphony". The movements are in the order II, IV, I, with III the current track.'
            /><br />

            The playback started with III and was to be followed by II, IV, and
            I. If I ask for a work, start at the beginning. If I want a specific
            movement, I will say so.
          </p>

          <h2>Apple Music Classical editors disregard works…</h2>
          <p>
            Recently, I dove into Dvořák. I know the "New World" Symphony well,
            but little else. I found this playlist<jp-footnote
              id="dvorak"
            ></jp-footnote
            >:
          </p>
          <iframe
            allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write"
            frameborder="0"
            height="450"
            style="
              width: 100%;
              max-width: 660px;
              overflow: hidden;
              border-radius: 10px;
            "
            sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation"
            src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/playlist/anton%C3%ADn-dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k-essentials/pl.e9a2ea836ac44812a8168976c6a94045"
          ></iframe>

          <p>
            The playlist includes only three of the four movements, scattered
            and from different performances. Multi-movement works demand to be
            heard whole. You can listen to a single movement—but deeper
            appreciation comes from the arc of the entire work.
          </p>

          <h2>…and also performances</h2>
          <p>
            The movements from Dvořák’s Ninth come from different
            performances—different conductors with different orchestras from a
            narrow five-year time window.
          </p>
          <p>
            A conductor interprets an entire work. Bernstein’s Shostakovich
            Fifth—especially the finale—was a watershed interpretation that even
            Shostakovich preferred. Comparing performances is one of classical
            music's great pleasures, but it's undercut by Apple Music
            Classical’s editors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Elsewhere, Apple Music Classical nails this. Its design surfaces a
            work’s variety of performances with a clear editorial perspective.
            <br /><img
              width="200"
              src="./images/shostakovich-fifth.png"
              class="lightbox"
              alt="A screenshot of Apple Music Classical’s view of Shostakovich’s fifth symphony showing an Editor’s Choice performance with Listening Guide and then additional performances."
            /><br />
            Here, editors spotlight a quintessential recording, foreground the
            diversity of performances, and provide context for the symphony’s
            reception and debates over interpretations. That’s excellent
            curation.
          </p>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Classical music can intimidate new listeners. Its work–movement
            structure feels foreign in the age of streaming singles, and the
            jargon doesn’t help. Apple Music Classical is uniquely positioned to
            change that. If Apple truly cares about the genre—guiding new
            listeners while earning connoisseurs’ trust—they must shoulder these
            editorial responsibilities.
